To execute each `PLACEHOLDER.feature.py` file, simply run `py PLACEHOLDER.feature.py browserName`,
where `PLACEHOLDER` is the test name and `browserName` is the browser you intend to use, which can be replaced with `chrome`, `safari`, or `firefox`. Make sure you have the relevant browser driver placed in your PATH. If you are using chrome, you do not need the `browserName` argument.

Examples: 

For using safari: `py complete_task.feature.py safari`

For using firefox: `py complete_task.feature.py firefox`

For using chrome (argument is optional): `py complete_task.feature.py`
